### *Modeling Healthcare Data with a 3D Force-Directed Network Graph*
This code generates a 3D Force-Directed Graph using a TigerGraph database, Python, and JavaScript
For a full look at this code, check out my blog [here.]()

## Motivation
Healthcare records have become oversaturated with data. Because of this, it is becoming increasingly hard to grab, analyze, and visualize patient data. I decided to explore using graph databases and network graph diagrams to possibly address these issues.

## Framework
All code written with [Atom.](https://atom.io/)
